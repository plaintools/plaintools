  <h1>Plain Tools</h1>

  <p>
    I like using open source software tools to automate the tedious parts of daily work.
    Increasingly, however, I find that modern tools come with complicated build processes
    or large dependency trees. I’ve spent a surprising amount of time just trying to set
    up a machine to <em>run</em> them.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site documents my attempt to work differently: to learn how to build and use
    <strong>plain tools</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    A plain tool is deliberately modest. It is typically:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>self-contained (often a single file),</li>
    <li>runnable with minimal setup,</li>
    <li>built on widely available foundations,</li>
    <li>free from complex or unnecessary frameworks and dependencies for the task at hand.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The emphasis is on building tools that can be easily run and understood, and handed
    over without elaborate infrastructure or specialist knowledge.
  </p>

  <h2>Inspirations</h2>

  <p>
    The ideas on this site are influenced by work that emphasizes simplicity,
    restraint, and building software that remains understandable and useful
    over time.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://www.hwaci.com/drh/" rel="external">D. Richard Hipp</a></strong> —
      through <a href="https://sqlite.org/" rel="external">SQLite</a>, which demonstrates how
      careful design, minimal dependencies, and a strong commitment to simplicity can
      produce software that is open source, widely deployed, and long-lived.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://horstmann.com/" rel="external">Cay Horstmann</a></strong> —
      in particular his talks on
      <a href="https://horstmann.com/presentations/2024/smalljava" rel="external">Small Java</a>
      and
      <a href="https://horstmann.com/presentations/2025/javaone/" rel="external">Java for Small Coding Tasks</a>,
      which argue for using a general-purpose language and its standard tools directly,
      without heavy frameworks, to build small programs.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://simonwillison.net/" rel="external">Simon Willison</a></strong> —
      particularly his writing and examples of build-free, single-file
      <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/" rel="external">tools</a>, including both
      <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/10/html-tools/" rel="external">plain HTML utilities</a>
      and self-contained,
      <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/python/" rel="external"><code>uv</code>-based Python scripts</a>
      designed to be easy to copy, run, and inspect.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://pragdave.me/" rel="external">Dave Thomas (“Prag Dave”)</a></strong> —
      especially his work on
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbtbh7dIUgo" rel="external">simplicity</a>,
      judgment, and avoiding accidental complexity in software development.
    </li>
  </ul>
